**Before build make sure to:**
- 1. Change ConnectionString in appsettings.json 
- 2. My example uses SqlServer 2019 Express Edition, if using different provider make sure to get the right package and change  the provider in the ConfigureSqlContext Service Extension. 
- 3. Open Package Manager Console and make first Migration (Add-Migration init) and (Update-Database) 
- 4. Make sure to change Nlog.confi file and modify a path for your own machine you want the logger to write to.
